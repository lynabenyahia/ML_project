## Presentation

[Source of Data]{.underline} : the Survey on Business Strategies

-   2000 manufacturing companies

-   121 992 observations

-   16 variables period : 1990-2012

[GOAL]{.underline} : Predict which company is going to be a HGF in the last of year of the sample

## Steps

###  NA Treatment

-   For the yearest, use the minimum of the id

-   Replace sales and va missing by mean of values before and after

-   Use the median for variables with remaining missing values

### Outliers Treatment

-   Delete outliers in "gom", extremely high comparing to the rest

### Creating new variables

-   Age, HGF and R&D


## Model

|               | Logistic regression | SVM   | K nearest neighbors | Decision tree | Random forest | XG Boost |
